# banner-grab
Simple Banner Grabbing Script in Python

Well, there's two script files in directory. Original one is bannergrab.py which has colouring text but it works
only on Linux machines. If you run it on Windows, it's does not work the coloring and will print ASCII codes which is
very annoying.
Unfortunately, Coloring works only on Linux. But there's one for Windows platform. File name is bangrab4wins.py.
That one works on Windows. (But no coloring)
